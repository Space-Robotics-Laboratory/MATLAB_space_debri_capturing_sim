# Simulation Structure
In "main_sim", the function of the code can be devided into 4 big parts. 
- Saved Data Update Part
- Contact Caliculation and Estimation Part
- Control Part
- Dynamics Caliculation Part

## Contorol Part
In this simulation, the robot is contolled by input motor torque, thus it's requred to caliculate the desired torque in order to control robot as you want. 

# How To Use
You can set control mode in controlParam.m file.
